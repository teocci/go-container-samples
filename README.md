## go-container-samples ![Go Reference][1]

`go-csv-samples` is an open-source implementation of a basic container build from scratch in Go solely for learning
purpose. It uses namespaces and cgroups, mount a tmpfs that's isolated from host filesystem.

### What it does

> **Note:** Before starting, you will have to extract the content of `ubuntu-fs.tar.gz` file into `./os-root-fs/ubuntu` which will be mounted as the container's root directory.

> **Note:** You will have to be inside a Linux box (Ubuntu in my case) to try this.

The example `5-isolate-cgroup-sample` is the full implementation, and it needs root privilege for creating `cgroup`:

### Usage
```bash
sudo su
go run main.go run /bin/bash
``` 

It will:
- Fork itself with `CLONE_NEWUTS`, `CLONE_NEWPID`, `CLONE_NEWNS` flags with isolated hostname, processes and mounts
- The forked process will create `cgroup` to limit memory usage of itself and any child process it creates
- Mount `./ubuntu` directory as root filesystem using `chroot` to limit access to host machine's filesystem
- Mount `/newtemp` directory as tmpfs. Any change made to this directory will not be visible from host.
- Mount proc (where `CLONE_NEWPID` namespace was already set) so that container can run `ps` and see only the processes
  running inside it.
- Execute the supplied argument `/bin/bash` inside the isolated environment

## Bonus tip: Setting up VS Code for cross-platform development

I have used Windows to develop the container from scratch and have run it inside Ubuntu in a virtualbox by sharing the
development directory. While this setup is fine for running the code inside Linux, the development experience is not
great because a lot of pieces of this application is Linux specific. For example, calls like `syscall.Sethostname` or
the `Cloneflags` field in the `syscall.SysProcAttr{}` struct is not available in intellisense in **VSCode** when the dev
environment is not Linux. **VSCode** will mark those lines as errors, because they are platform specific and declared in
the standard library in Go for Linux only.

Fortunately, there is a workaround, and it is very simple. Search for `"go.toolsEnvVars"` in **VSCode** settings, copy it to User Settings and change it to:

```json
"go.toolsEnvVars": {
    "GOOS": "linux"
}
```
Now restart **VSCode** and after that it will recognize all Linux specific declarations and will not see them as errors.
`Go-to-definition` will work properly too.
